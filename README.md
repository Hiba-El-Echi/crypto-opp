## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git](https://github.com/Hiba-El-Echi/crypto-opp.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd crypto-app`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

You should now see the default React app running with Vite's fast development environment.

## Folder Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/` contains the main source code for your application.
  - `components/` should contain your React components.
  - `redux/` contains Redux-related code such as actions, reducers, and store configuration.
  - `App.js` is the entry point of your application.
- `public/` contains static assets that will be served as-is.

Feel free to reorganize or expand upon this structure as your project evolves.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server using Vite.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm start`: Serves the production build.
- `npm test`: Runs your test suite.

Refer to the `package.json` file for additional scripts and dependencies.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux: A predictable state container for managing global application state.
- Vite: A fast build tool that focuses on speed and simplicity.
